## 🏗️ Odoo Framework & Architecture
### MVC Structure
Odoo follows the MVC architecture, which separates concerns into three primary components:
- **Model:** Handles database interactions via Odoo's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
- **View:** Defines UI elements using XML templates and QWeb.
- **Controller:** Manages business logic and connects the model and view.
